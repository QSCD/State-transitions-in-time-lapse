% having run all the required sampleSizes, repeats and bootstraps on the queue 
%   (see qJob_lassoGLM(), createInputs_4_featureSelection_vs_samplesize)
% this functions evaluates the results we get from the queue_collectResults, sorting the results
% according to sampel size and repeat.
%
% INPUTS:
%   aggr_outputs: the cell returned by qOpt_collectResults_general()
%   sampleSizes : vector of sample sizes that were used to run the queue jobs
%   nRepeats    : how often did we repeat each sample size (typically 10)
%
% OUTPUTS:
%   inclusion_vs_sampleSize : nested cell array containing the inclusion probs for all repeats and sampleSize: first dimesion sample size
%   B_vs_sampleSize         : 2D-cell array storing the B-matrix returned by lassoGLM() for each sampleSize and repeat
%   fitinfo_vs_sampleSize   : 2D-cell array storing the fitinfo returned by lassoGLM() for each sampleSize and repeat
